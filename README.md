# Psychic-Game

This is a game made in javascript that will generate a random number(0-9) and ask you to guess the number it is thinking of.

You get three tries to guess the number right. If you dont get it right it will count as a loss and it will tell you the correct answer and then reset and pick another random number(0-9). If you guess the number correctly, you will be congradulated, the number will reset and you will gain one in the wins category.
